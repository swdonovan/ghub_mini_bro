        is the giant branch of serializer.  I kept thinking we were going to merge
        it and I needed the code inside so I just kept piling it on. Thats terrible
        project flow on my part.  \r\nEverything in here is Record endpoint w/ Merchant
        & Transactions Relationship Endpoint. There is a few different changes with
        the migrations that we will have to handle delicately with merging and merging
        yours as well and getting out computers on sync.  \r\nAs you know probably
        to well, there will be a ton merge conflicts with both of our merges so we
        will have to slot out at least an hour tomorrow.  It wouldn''t be a big deal
        but since i compounded the code on this, there may be some stuff that I will
        have to explain.  If you have any questions of comments dont hesitate to throw
        them up on here so we can get to it before tomorrow.

        is the giant branch of serializer.  I kept thinking we were going to merge
        it and I needed the code inside so I just kept piling it on. Thats terrible
        project flow on my part.  \r\nEverything in here is Record endpoint w/ Merchant
        & Transactions Relationship Endpoint. There is a few different changes with
        the migrations that we will have to handle delicately with merging and merging
        yours as well and getting out computers on sync.  \r\nAs you know probably
        to well, there will be a ton merge conflicts with both of our merges so we
        will have to slot out at least an hour tomorrow.  It wouldn''t be a big deal
        but since i compounded the code on this, there may be some stuff that I will
        have to explain.  If you have any questions of comments dont hesitate to throw
        them up on here so we can get to it before tomorrow.
